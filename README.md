Hello! I'm [Bigjango13](https://github.com/Bigjango13), I'm interested in compilers (mostly ahead of time compilers, for both native and VM targets), cybersecurity, and some types of medical technology. I enjoy programming in C++, but have some experience in Python and Rust.

My favorite project I worked on is [Burlap](https://github.com/Bigjango13/Burlap), an bytecode-VM-based interpreter of the [Sack](https://github.com/RandomSoup/sack) programming language. It was really fun to make, and continue to hack on with [nobody5050](https://github.com/nobody5050).
